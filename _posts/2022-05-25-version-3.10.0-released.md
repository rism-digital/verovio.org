We are glad to announce the release of Verovio 3.10!

As always, this release includes many improvements of the rendering output of Verovio. It also includes some new options for controlling the output. See the [release announcement](https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/releases/tag/version-3.10.0) for more details about these.

This release also includes a new `select` toolkit function which allows for some partial content of the score to be specified for rendering. Once selected, the portion of the score will be laid out and rendered as a normal score, which can result in multiple pages depending on the size of the selection and of the size of the output page. The documentation is in preparation and will be added to the Reference book.

Please note that there will be some [changes](https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/discussions/2897) in which development versions will be available through the development CI after the release of version 3.11 and that some of them are now deprecated.
