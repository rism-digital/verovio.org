Verovio 3.13.0 is out!

One important change with this release is related to the Python binding and the way JSON objects are passed to or returned by it. It is no longer needed to stringify the JSON objects and the toolkit now takes and return Python dictionaries. Make sure you update your code if you update to the latest version!

Verovio has now a font fallback when the selected font is missing some glyphs. This fxes problem introduced in the latest release when improving text font support. Another new feature is the control of the log level, with four levels (info, warning, error and debug). Controlling the log level is also available for the Python and the JavaScript binding.

As always, this release includes many improvements of the rendering output of Verovio. It also includes some new options for controlling the output. See the [release announcement](https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/releases/tag/version-3.13.0) for more details about these.
