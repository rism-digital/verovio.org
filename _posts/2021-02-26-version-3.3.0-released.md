Although you would not know it from the number of news posts we have been busy
this past year, releasing several major updates. The latest update, Verovio [3.3.0](https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/releases/tag/version-3.3.0) is now available.

This release includes a number of improvements, including support for compressed
MusicXML files (`.mxl`). In addition to the improvements to the core code, our
contributors have been hard at work making Verovio available as a Python package
over on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/verovio/).

Several other notable improvements have been rolled in to Verovio over the past
year. Here are just some highlights:

  - Availability of the new SMuFL-compatible [Leland font](https://github.com/MuseScoreFonts/Leland) from MuseScore
  - Significant improvements to the rendering of mensural and neume notation
  - Many new musical symbols supported

... In addition to the standard list of bug fixes and improvements.

Many thanks to all of our contributors, and if you have a few minutes, go
catch up on the [Release Notes](https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/releases) to
see what else is in there.
